# ClearLane Initiative - Complete Website Architecture

## Executive Summary

**Mission**: Transform a CUNY student's 2-hour BxM10 "rolling study hall" into a compelling data story that reveals systemic enforcement gaps affecting 735,000+ students across 28 CUNY campuses.

**Key Achievement**: Successfully synthesized 5 comprehensive notebooks (453,935 violations, 41 engineered features, 85.6% validation failure rate) into an 8-section narrative architecture that maintains emotional connection while delivering defensible analytical insights.
