Notebook 05: ACE Intelligence System -
Focused Analysis (The ClearLane Initiative)
Part 1: Initial Setup and Data Foundation
The notebook begins by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas for data handling and
geopandas and folium for spatial analysis and visualization. It establishes the critical paths,
defining where the raw violations data and the GTFS (bus stops) data reside.
The core data loading step pulls the entire violations dataset, consisting of 3,778,568 records. This
is the full analytical foundation. Concurrently, the notebook collects bus stop location data by
scanning all stops.txt files across all borough GTFS folders, consolidating thousands of physical
stop locations into a master list that can be spatially referenced.
Part 2: Isolating the Chronic Problem (The Exempt Filter)
This section executes the crucial analytical filter designed to isolate the most disruptive behavior,
which is identified as the chronic abuse of bus lanes by authorized but problematic vehicles.
The notebook filters the entire dataset exclusively for violations where the violation_status
contains the string 'EXEMPT'. This isolates the policy-driven loophole, focusing the subsequent
analysis purely on this chronic source of disruption.
This filtered dataset is then enriched by linking each violation to its nearest corresponding bus stop
location identified in Part 1. This step ensures the focus is hyper-localized, supporting the central
claim that "The Problem is Local, Not Global".
Part 3: Spatial Pinpointing and CUNY Linkage
To anchor the narrative around student impact, the analysis loads the precise coordinates for CUNY
campuses (e.g., Hunter, City, Baruch, Brooklyn, Queens, John Jay, Lehman, College of Staten
Island).
Using proximity checks (inferred via Haversine logic from previous notebooks), the notebook
specifically identifies and isolates only those exempt violations that occur within a 500-meter radius
of a CUNY campus. The resulting dataset, cuny_exempt_hotspots, represents the most critical
locations impacting student commutes and is necessary to ensure student corridors receive
"proper attention".
The analysis immediately provides a quantitative summary: it identified hundreds of exempt
violations directly affecting CUNY students, confirming these are the most critical locations
impacting access and transit reliability for students.
Part 4: Temporal Priority Scoring (The 7–10 AM Peak)
To move beyond simply counting total violations, the analysis introduces a temporal priority layer.
This addresses the insight that violations during peak commuting hours are vastly more disruptive
than those during off-peak times.
• Peak Window Definition: The notebook defines the peak student commute window as weekday
mornings between 7 AM and 10 AM. This window is chosen because these violations are "directly
impacting students and commuters during the most critical travel window."
• Metric Calculation: A specific metric, peak_time_violation_count, is calculated by counting
all exempt violations at each CUNY hotspot that occurred during this specific 7–10 AM weekday
block. The analysis confirms the data "clearly shows that the peak hour for exempt violations is
around 7-10 AM," suggesting the problem is highly predictable.
Part 5: Synthesis and Final ClearLane Target List Generation
This is the final strategic step, synthesizing the spatial (where) and temporal (when) analysis into a
single, actionable list.
• The Priority Score: The notebook generates the ClearLane Priority Score by merging the
total exempt violation count with the peak time violation count. Crucially, the code is designed to
weigh the peak time violations higher because they are considered inherently "more disruptive"
and urgent for intervention.

• Final Output: This prioritized list is formatted into the definitive report table
(final_recommendation_df). The columns are renamed for executive clarity: Bus Stop, Total
Exempt Violations, Violations During Student Commute (7-10AM M-F), and the
ClearLane Priority Score.
• Data Export: This crucial, high-value table is saved to disk at the path
../data/processed/clear_lane_target_list.csv.
The notebook's display of the top hotspots provides specific examples of extreme concentration. For
instance, the highest priority location (identified as index '0') is cited with 16,868 total violations,
of which 8,253 occurred specifically during the morning student commute, offering concrete proof of
localized failure.
Part 6: Formulating the Strategic Narrative
The notebook concludes with a detailed narrative intended for the final presentation to MTA
leadership, tying the quantitative analysis back to the overall project theme.
1. Local vs. Global: It emphasizes that the original city-wide analysis showed no clear link between
violations and bus speeds, leading to the critical discovery that the impact is hyper-concentrated at
a few critical bus stops.
2. The ClearLane Recommendation: The actionable outcome is the "ClearLane" Initiative: a call to
"deploy enforcement resources to the top 10 high-priority bus stops" identified in the list during
the specific 7-10 AM weekday peak.
3. Surgical Impact: This approach is framed as a "surgical, high-impact use of resources" that can
significantly reduce blockages and improve bus speeds on critical student corridors, protecting
the "rolling study halls" that are vital to student success.
4. Strategic Focus Justification: The notebook explicitly defends the decision to prioritize this
issue over other complex questions (like Datathon Question 3): the data revealed that the "most
immediate, solvable, and high-impact issue for bus riders is not zone-wide," but the chronic,
localized exempt vehicle blockages.
This narrative integration ensures that Notebook 05 serves as the core policy briefing document,
translating millions of data points into a clear, immediate operational plan.
