# ACE Intelligence System by Jujutsu Query

ClearLane is a student led analysis and product concept that studies NYC bus lane violations and their impact on bus performance and student commutes, the project combines a Streamlit dashboard, a public facing Astro site, reproducible notebooks, and exported results, the goal is simple, build from a basic exploration to a focused, decision ready story that shows where enforcement should be placed and when it should be there, everything in this repository supports that arc, from raw analysis to a policy ready narrative.

## The central idea and narrative

Buses act like educational infrastructure for CUNY students, the commute is a rolling study hall that should be protected, violations are not random, they cluster at a small set of locations and they peak during school commute hours, a targeted approach called ClearLane focuses enforcement on those locations during those hours, which is expected to raise speeds and give students back study time, the numbers you see below are tied to the specific sources where they appear in code and results so a reader can follow the trail.

- Scale of violations, 3,778,568 violation records across 2019 to Aug 2025 used in feature engineering, source results/txt/02_feature_engineering.txt, some pages mention 2.4M plus which refers to an earlier slice used for writing, the modeling work uses 3.78M
- Enforcement performance headline, results/txt/03_continued_predictive_story.txt opens with a 97.5 percent failure claim drawn from earlier work, the validation section inside the same text calculates an 85.6 percent failure rate over 557 routes using speed change percent, both appear because they refer to different inputs, the computed figure for that specific route set is 85.6 percent
- Hotspot focus, site content speaks about roughly 90 priority locations as a working number for deployment, dashboard material sometimes shows the top 100 hotspots for exploration

## How to read this repository

Start with the dashboards to build intuition about the problem, read the results texts to learn how features and scores are built, use the site pages to communicate the story to leaders and the public, and when it is time to build models or run experiments load the modeling parquet and work from there, the sections below walk through every folder and file and explain how they fit into that path.

## Root level files

- `.env.example`, a template for environment variables used by local tooling and dashboards when needed, leave it as is and copy to a real `.env` if you wire in secrets for external services
- `astro.config.mjs`, configuration for the Astro site that lives under `src`, it sets integrations, paths, build settings, and is read by the web build system when the site is compiled for production
- `LICENSE`, the legal license for this repository, read it to understand how the work can be reused
- `README.md`, this document which guides any reader from a middle schooler to a graduate student through the structure and intent of the work
- `requirements.txt`, Python dependencies for the Streamlit dashboards and notebooks, install with pip to run local dashboards and notebooks
- `vercel.json`, deployment configuration for hosting the Astro site on Vercel which sets headers and routes, the site reads this when built and deployed

## Directory by directory guide

### `dashboard/` the interactive analysis space in Streamlit

This folder holds a self contained Streamlit experience that mirrors the narrative, a reader can click through a human story, a problem statement grounded in data, an interactive 3D map when generated, and a target list, this is where someone starts when they want to touch the data quickly without reading code.

- `dashboard/app.py`, a single page Streamlit app with a left sidebar that lets a person navigate between sections, the page called The Rolling Study Hall introduces the student centric frame, the page called The Problem is Local and Predictable shows a hotspot map and time charts, the page called Interactive 3D Bus Route Map embeds a Kepler based map after it is generated by a script, the page called The ClearLane Solution displays the target list table if the CSV is present, a sidebar button triggers the 3D map generator script in the notebooks folder using a subprocess
- `dashboard/run_dashboard.py`, a small launcher that sets up and runs the dashboard with dependency checks, run `python dashboard/run_dashboard.py` from the repository root to start quickly

## How the pieces fit together

1, begin with the dashboards, look at weekday bars, hourly lines, a heat map by weekday hour, top stops, a before and after speed view, and a map, this builds intuition
2, read the results texts in `results/txt/` to learn how features and scores are built, formulas and choices are written in the text so the logic is transparent
3, use the site pages to communicate with a broader audience, the home page sets the scene, methodology builds trust, solution and policy pages translate findings into actions
4, when modeling, load `data/processed/modeling_dataset.parquet`, the features cover time, space, campus proximity, adaptation, and multiple targets that serve immediate and tactical horizons

## Notes on figures and scope

Because code paths and reports cover different time ranges and subsets, numbers appear with different scopes in different places, this README quotes the number and the file where the number came from so a reader can match it to the exact context, the modeling dataset count of 3.78M records is from results/txt/02_feature_engineering.txt, the 85.6 percent failure rate over 557 routes is from results/txt/03_continued_predictive_story.txt, hotspots are discussed as roughly 90 priority locations in site content while some dashboards list the top 100 for exploration.

## How to run things quickly

- Install Python dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Launch the story style dashboard from the repository root, run `python dashboard/run_dashboard.py`
- Launch the multi page dashboards, change directory into `dashboard/dashboards/` and run `streamlit run app.py`
- Build or preview the Astro site with your usual Astro workflow, `astro.config.mjs` governs the build
