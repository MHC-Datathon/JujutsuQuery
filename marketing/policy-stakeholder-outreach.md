Subject: Student Research on NYC Bus Lane Enforcement - Policy Briefing Request

Dear [Title] [Last Name],

I am writing to share groundbreaking research from the ClearLane Initiative that documents how bus lane violations significantly impact educational access for NYC students, particularly the 275,000+ students across the CUNY system.

Our comprehensive analysis of 2.4+ million violation records reveals that current enforcement gaps increase student commute times by 47% on average, contributing to missed classes and reduced academic performance. The economic impact totals $2.4 million annually in lost student productivity alone.

We have developed evidence-based policy recommendations that could reduce bus delays by 40% while generating $8.7 million in annual benefits for the city. Given your leadership role in [relevant area], we would welcome the opportunity to present our findings and discuss implementation opportunities.

Our research and recommendations are detailed at clearlane.org, and we have prepared materials specifically relevant to your priorities and authority.

Would you be available for a 30-45 minute briefing in the coming weeks? We are flexible with timing and format (in-person, virtual, or at your office).

Thank you for your consideration and leadership on transportation equity issues.

Best regards,
